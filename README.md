2. Additionally, this project is a testbed for human-LLM hybrid development
   a. Contributions will be accepted from Individuals
   b. Individuals in this case includes:
     i.   a real human person (aka classic coder)
     ii.  a real human person that uses LLM sparingly (classic coder embracing some parts of LLM)  
     iii. a real human person that primarially uses LLM (vibe coders)
   c. All contributions should clearly label which category they fall into.
   d. Continuous improper labeling will lead to revocation of merge permissions.
